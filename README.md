# Xavier-s-Modpack-Manager
A simple modpack installer that does not rely on centralized servers. Easily configurable with .toml, you just zip up your mods and config files with it, and it's good to go. 

At the moment, it's just a commandline program, but when all the base functionality is complete, I'll work on a GUI version.
